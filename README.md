Overview of the Project:-


1.Designing the Circuits

Logic Gates:
- AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR gates: These are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. You define these gates in Verilog by specifying their input-output relationships.

Adders:
- Half Adder: A basic circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers and produces a sum and a carry.
- Full Adder: Extends the half adder by adding three single-bit binary numbers (including a carry-in) and produces a sum and a carry-out.

Multiplexers:
- 2:1 Multiplexer: Selects one of two inputs based on a single select line.
- 4:1 Multiplexer: Selects one of four inputs based on two select lines.

 2. Writing Verilog Code

- Module Definition: Each circuit is defined as a Verilog module, specifying its inputs and outputs.
- Behavioral Description: The functionality of the circuit is described using continuous assignments (`assign` statements) or always blocks for more complex behavior.

3. Simulation Setup

- Testbench Creation: A separate Verilog file (testbench) is written to apply test vectors (inputs) to the design and observe the outputs. This testbench mimics the operational environment of the circuit.
- Waveform Viewer: The VLSI software includes a waveform viewer to visualize the output signals over time. This helps in verifying if the circuit behaves as expected.

 4. Running Simulations
- Compile and Run**: The Verilog code and testbench are compiled and simulated using the VLSI software's simulator.
- Analyze Waveforms: Use the waveform viewer to examine the timing and logic levels of the outputs. Look for any discrepancies between expected and actual behavior.

 5. Debugging and Verification

- Troubleshooting: If the circuit does not function correctly, you may need to debug the Verilog code. This involves checking for syntax errors, logical errors, or timing issues.
- Re-simulation: After making corrections, re-simulate the design and re-analyze the waveforms to ensure correctness.

 6. Final Validation

- Functional Verification: Confirm that the circuit meets the design specifications and performs all intended operations correctly.
- Documentation: Document the design, simulation results, and any observations.
